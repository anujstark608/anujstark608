I am a recent graduate in Computer Science and aspiring to be a developer. I am open to work on mobile applications and backend projects. You can find some of the interesting and most useful projects that I did during my academic learning. Feel free to send me an email on patelanuj608@gmail.com for any kind of collaboration.
Here is a link to my bitbucket repository. It is an android app with web application for simulating waiting room experience of a dental clinic. https://bitbucket.org/cstprojects/cosa290/src/master/
